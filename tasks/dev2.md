## `src/app/page.tsx` — Landing page

- 4 pinned evidence cards scattered at angles (photos, case notes) — purely decorative, static HTML
- Red strings connecting pins (SVG lines)

- Live countdown using `useEffect` + `setInterval` (1s tick)
- `TARGET: 25 AUG 2027 · 23:59 ICT` footer in Special Elite

**CTA button**

## `src/components/house/house-card.tsx`

Used in the houses grid. Props:

```ts
type HouseCardProps = {
  houseKey: HouseKey;
  memberCount: number;
  onClick?: () => void;
};
```

Design from `reference/Houses.dc.html` house cards:
- `#E5E0CF` card (aged paper) with colored left border (4px, house primary color)
- Or: card with house-colored header band at top
- House name in Cinzel Decorative
- Tagline in Cormorant Garamond muted
- Member count badge in house primary color text
- Hover: slight lift (`translateY(-2px)`) + border brightens
- Click navigates to `/houses/[houseKey]`

House icons/emblems (reference for each):
- **Evidence Hounds**: magnifying glass or paw print
- **Inference Society**: deduction/logic symbol (Σ or tree)
- **Cipher Foxes**: fox or cipher wheel
- **Shadow Sleuths**: eye or shadow figure

---

## `src/app/(main)/houses/page.tsx` — Houses directory + onboarding

Reference: `reference/Houses.dc.html`

### Data fetching
- Call `GET /api/auth/me` on load to get current user
- If `user.nickname === null` → show onboarding overlay on mount

### House grid
- `DETECTIVE DIVISIONS` label header in Special Elite red
- Title: "Choose Your Division" in Cinzel Decorative
- 2-column grid of `<HouseCard />` components
- Member counts fetched from `GET /api/students?house=X` or included in `/api/auth/me`

### Onboarding overlay (show when `nickname === null`)
Renders on top of the blurred house grid (`filter: blur(2px)` on background when open).

Bottom sheet slides up from below.

**Step 1 — Alias Assignment**
- Label: `STEP 1 OF 2 · ALIAS ASSIGNMENT` in Special Elite
- Title: "Choose Your Alias" in Cinzel Decorative
- Text input with `›` prefix, amber caret
- "Confirm Alias" dark `#2F241F` button → validate (2–30 chars, not empty) → POST `/api/auth/complete-registration` with `{ nickname }` → advance to step 2

**Step 2 — Magic Pot House Reveal**
- Label: `STEP 2 OF 2 · DIVISION ASSIGNMENT` in Special Elite
- Title: "The Magic Pot Decides" in Cinzel Decorative
- Spinning amber ring animation (1s), then reveal after 1.2s delay
- House reveal card animates in: `YOU HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO` + house name + tagline
- House card uses the house primary color as accent
- "Enter Division HQ" button → dismiss overlay

> The house is already assigned server-side at registration (stored on `student.house`). Dev 2 only reads it from the `/api/auth/me` response — does not assign the house.

---

## Notes

- Countdown must handle server/client hydration — use `useState` with initial `'--'` and set real values only inside `useEffect`
- The onboarding overlay is client-side state only — no route change, just a modal
- Do not implement the `/api/auth/complete-registration` route (that's Dev 1) — just call it
- After nickname save, re-fetch `/api/auth/me` or update local state so the overlay doesn't reopen
- Bottom tabs are NOT shown on the landing page (`/`) — only in the `(main)` route group
